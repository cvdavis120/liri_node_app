# liri_node_app

## Problem 
The problem presented for this project was to help a user search multiple APIs with a single app. Not only can they find a song they like, but then see if that artist has a concert near by! 

## Organization 
The app is organized into functions for each feature of the app. 
* The Spotify Search
* The Band Search 
* The Movie Search
* File Command
With a single function that reads the user command and then runs the needed function.

## Running the app
The app takes in four commands:
* concert-this
* spotify-this-song
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says
With the wanted info after the command in the node.js command line. 
1. Navigate to the file inside termial/cmd 
2. type "node lire.js 'command' 'band name...etc.'" 
3. Watch the info pop in the bash.
